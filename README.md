# TheCodeFool
"If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise."
-William Blake

## Summary
TheCodeFool will be my personal portfolio website. The design was originally intended as a website for a Tarot-reading practice, and the visual theme is still inspired by the bold colors of the classic Rider-Waite Tarot deck. The design is ultra-minimalist. The only component on the page is a menu with four different options, each of which activates a modal. All the page content is stored in modals.

## Why React?
I was able to accomplish most of what I wanted with Bootstrap alone, but React will some features a little easier. For instance, I want the Portfolio and Blog modals to populate with data from external JSON files, which will be easier to manage with React. I also want the user to be able to choose between list and icon views. Also, I mean, why *not* React?

## Components

### Menu:
- Vertical button group with border
- Card-flipping effect, currently done with jQuery but React probably has a better way of doing it.

### Modals:
- Five of them, one for each menu option plus a splash modal that appears on pageload.

There will be more, of course, but I will hold off on enumerating them until I have drawn up a more detailed plan of what I want my Portfolio and Blog modals to look like.
